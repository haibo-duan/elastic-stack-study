### task1

Define a new data stream on `cluster1` that satisfies the following requirements:

* the index pattern for the data stream is `mylogs-*-*`
* the corresponding index template is named `task1`
* the data is assigned to data_hot nodes for the first 5 minutes, then the data rolls over immediately to data_warm
  nodes
* the data is on data_warm nodes for 3 minutes, then moves to data_cold nodes
* 6 minutes after rolling over, the data is deleted

After your data stream is defined, index the following document into `cluster1`:

```
